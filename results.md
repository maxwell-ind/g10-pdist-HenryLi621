# Distributional Analysis Questions

## Q1: Pooled types

Looking at the results for income quintiles alone (when the types are grouped together), does the tax progressive, proportional, or regressive? How can you tell? What is the difference in ETR between the lowest quintile and highest quintile? Note that it's fine to calculate that with a calculator: you don't need to build it into the script.

* **Answer**: TBD

## Q2: Pooled incomes

Now look at the results for types alone (when all incomes are grouped together). Do the ETRs differ? If so, say a little about what you see.

* **Answer**: TBD

## Q3: Disaggregated results

Now look at the detailed results that are disaggregated by both type and quintile. Within any given type does the tax look progressive, proportional, or regressive? What is the difference between the ETRs of the highest and lowest quintiles for each group?

* **Answer**: TBD

## Q4: Conclusion

If an analyst failed to calculate the detailed results and looked only at the ETRs by overall quintile (Q1), would they overstate or understate the policy's progressivity or regressivity? Briefly explain. If possible, also explain why it happens using the insights above.

* **Answer**: TBD
